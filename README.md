# Stock Analysis README

This repository contains a Python script for **analyzing and visualizing** the stock data of three well-known companies: **Apple, Tesla, and Amazon**. The script employs various techniques to gain insights into the stock market trends, volatility, and market capitalization of these companies over a specified time period.

## Steps for Stock Analysis

### Step 1: Import Data

In this initial step, we import the required libraries, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `yfinance`. We also define the start and end dates for data retrieval from the stock market.

### Step 2: Data Analysis

In this step, we perform data analysis on the downloaded stock data for Apple, Tesla, and Amazon. We identify the data type of each column, determine the total count of elements, calculate the number of missing values, and compute the percentage of missing values.

### Step 3: Visualizing Trade Volume

We visualize the average trade volume over time for each stock. We also create a pie chart to compare the average trade volume of these stocks, highlighting which stock has the highest trading volume.

### Step 4: Market Capitalization Analysis

We calculate the market capitalization for each company by multiplying the opening price with the trading volume. Subsequently, we visualize the market capitalization trends for Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.

### Step 5: Moving Averages

Moving averages are utilized to address price fluctuations and detect trends. We calculate the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for each stock, and then plot them to visually identify upward or downward trends.

### Step 6: Volatility and Stability

We examine the volatility and stability of each stock by calculating daily returns. Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of returns for Apple, Tesla, and Amazon. This analysis allows us to identify which stock is the most volatile based on the thickness of the histogram.

### Step 7: Correlation Analysis

We calculate and visualize the correlation between different columns in the dataset, specifically focusing on volume, open price, high price, low price, and closing price. Heatmaps are used to display the correlation matrices for each stock.

### Step 8: Final Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted on the stock data, a final conclusion is drawn. The conclusion evaluates various factors such as trading volume, market capitalization, trends, volatility, and correlation among the stocks. For the given time period, the analysis suggests which stock could be the most favorable option.
